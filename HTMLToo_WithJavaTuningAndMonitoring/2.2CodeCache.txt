Code Cache-->Special area of memory where the JVM stores the mostly used code to make the exeuction faster.

If the code cache size is not large enough then the java vm wil throw an warning saying the code cache is full and the compilation is stopped.

We can print the code cache size by turning on the flag "PrintCodeCache" which will print the code cache details on console.
-XX:+PrintCodeCache

We can tune and control the size of the code cache by setting the flags 
InitialCodeCacheSize-->The starting size of code cache
ReservedCodeCacheSize-->The maximum size to which the code cache can be expanded
CodeCacheExpansionSize-->the factor by which the code cache can be expanded from Initial to Reserved
