Java has 3 different types of memory sections

-->Stack
-->Heap
-->Metaspace


--------------

Stack

It is not a single block of memory but every thread has its own stack.

Stack works on the concept of last in first out which means everytime a new data membe is entered into the datastructure  the previous ones are pushed down, and the element which is inseted recently will be the first one to be removed.

Stack is used to store the local variables, the local variables are destroyed automatically when the local method/code block is ended.
Due to this usage of storing the local variables and each thread having its own stack, the individual threads can only have the visibility over the elements stored in it(that is the varialbes stored in the stack can only be acccessed by respective threads.
