How to increase the number of threads allocated to perform the compilation at runtime.

we can use printFlagsFinal advanced option to print all the flags which are set for the java virtual machine.

There is no need to provide any class name in order to perform this operation

java -XX:PrintFlagsFinal

Here the problem is it will print every info hence it will be difficult to search the information we are looking for,


We can use jps command to print the process ids of all the running java applications.

jinfo command is useful where we can mention only the intended flag and it returns the flag value for the particular process(application)

jinfo -flag <FlagName> processID 

-------------------------

CICompilerCount : It is the flag which decideds how many theads are to be used for JIT compilation, the minimum value for this flag is 1 for 32 bit compilers and 2 for y64 bit compilers


We can set the CIComplierCount Flag while running the application by using -XX:CICompilerCount=<Number of threads to be used>
