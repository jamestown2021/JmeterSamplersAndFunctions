<p id="TieredCompilation">
<h5>JVM Compilers</h5>
<br>

Normally JVM uses tiered compilation in order to deliver the optimal performance. However we can make the JVM run in interpreter by turning off the<b>"TieredCompilation" </b>flag. This will make the JVM run the code only in the interpreted mode.
<br>
We can also make the JVM make the method complied/store the method in the code cache by setting the <b>"CompileThreshold"</b> value. By default the value is 10k and after the method has executed for 10k times the method will be native complied and plced in the code cache for execution.
